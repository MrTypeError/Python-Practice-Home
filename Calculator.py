# Initial Thinking By eval 

'''We have not implimented that because it is 
very prone to errors and is not good with respect to security 
'''

# def Calculator(expression):
#     result = eval(expression)
#     return result


# expression = input("Enter a Number :-")
# Calculator(expression)


# Another Approach 
result = [] 
expression = input()

storage_list = list(expression)
# storage_list.append()
print(storage_list)
